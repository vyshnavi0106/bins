<h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
<h2>BY <u>VYSHNAVI</u></h2>
<p
 <div>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood</div>
 <div>And sorry I <del>could</del> <ins>could not</ins> travelled both</div>
 <div>And be one traveller,long I stood</div>
 <div>And looked down one as far as I could</div>
 <div>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</div>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<div>Then took the other,has just as fair,</div>
<div>And having perhaps the better claim,</div>
<div>because it was grassy and wanted wear;</div>
<div>through has four that the passing there</div>
<div>had wore them really about the same,</div>
</p>
<br>
<div>And both that morning equally lay</div>
<div>In leaves no step had trodden <em>black</em>.</div>
<div>Oh,I kept the first for another day!</div>
<div>yet knowing how way leads onto way,</div>
<div>I doubted if I should ever come back.</div>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<div>I shall be telling this with a sigh</div>
<div>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</div>
<div>Two roads <q>diverged in a wood</q>, and</div> 
<div>I took the one less travelled by,</div>
<div>and that has made all the difference.</div>
